Chisora (35-13) is a former British, Commonwealth, and European champion. The veteran has twice fought for the WBC title, losing against Tyson Fury and Vitali Klitschko. "Del Boy" has won two straight since his third loss against Fury in 2022. 

The event, dubbed "The Last Dance," will be the 49th fight of Chisora’s career. He hopes to make it to 50 fights, so he must beat Wallin. Chisora has been calm during fight week but plans to bring out the beast within on fight night. 

"If I was a different fighter and I was saying something you’d be like, 'Yeah whatever, he’s talking crap.' But I don’t talk crap, so Otto Wallin knows I’m going to break him," Chisora told iFL TV via Bad Left Hook. "I’m going to break his heart, I’m going to break him mentally. I’m telling you right now, I’m going to break that guy, I’m going to smoke that m-----f-----, man.

"I don’t go in the ring upset, I go in the ring happy but I just want to physically hurt the other man. I want to hurt him, I don’t hate him, I just want to f-----’ physically hurt him. And that’s what I’m going to do on Saturday night."

Wallin (27-2) is known for taking Fury to the limit in a loss in 2019. The eleven-time medalist at the amateur level went on a six-fight win streak following that fight before getting knocked out against Anthony Joshua in 2023. The game fighter from Sweden rebounded with a win in July against Onoriode Ehwarieme.
